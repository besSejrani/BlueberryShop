# Configuration

## Relative Imports

Importing long relative path for a lot of components can be a long taking and tedious task, that's why in the tsconfig.jsonpaths to relative folder have been already set.

=== "Tsconfig.json"

    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": ".",
          "@Components/*":  ["Components/*"],
          "@Apollo/*":      ["Apollo/*"],
          "@Graphql/*":     ["Graphql/*"],
          "@Hook/*":        ["Hook/*"],
          "@Guard/*":       ["Guard/*"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```typescript
    //Apollo
    import { useGetProductsQuery } from "@Graphql/index";

    // SSR
    import withApollo from "@Apollo/ssr";
    ```

## Environement Variables

By creating an <b>.env</b> environment file, it's possible to add information and then retrieve it in the application at any time.
It behaves like a central store, it's perfect for storing repeatable information like URLs.

!!! warning

    All the information exposed in Next.js are not private, every one can see them.
    Do not store confidential information on Next via environement variables.

=== ".env"

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER=http://localhost:4000/graphql
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_SERVER=https://blueberryshop.herokuapp.com/graphql
```

<hr/>

## GraphQL Code Generator

Since all the backend is written in Typescript, it would be great to use those same types in the the frontend. That's exactly what GraphQL Code Generator does, it converts the backend API into Typescript.

GraphQL Code Generator needs raw .graphql files to interact with the server.

=== ".graphql"

```YAML

mutation AddProfilePicture($picture: Upload!) {
  addProfilePicture(picture: $picture)
}
```

GraphQL Code Generator needs a configuration file, named codegen.yaml, it explains to it, how to reach the server and how to retrieve the types. For the project, there are two files, one for development and one for production.

=== "GraphQL Code Generator Development"

    ```YAML
    overwrite: true
    schema: ${NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER}
    documents: "./Graphql/**/**/*.graphql"
    # watch: true
    generates:
      Graphql/graphql-hooks.ts:
        plugins:
          - "typescript"
          - "typescript-operations"
          - "typescript-react-apollo"
        config:
          withHOC: false
          withComponent: false
          withHooks: true

    ```

=== "GraphQL Code Generator Production"

    ```yaml
    overwrite: true
    schema: ${NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_SERVER}
    documents: "./Graphql/**/**/*.graphql"
    # watch: true
    generates:
      Graphql/graphql-hooks.ts:
        plugins:
          - "typescript"
          - "typescript-operations"
          - "typescript-react-apollo"
        config:
          withHOC: false
          withComponent: false
          withHooks: true
    ```

In the package.json file on the client, there is a generate script to execute. The server must be running, otherwise the action will fail.

=== "script"

```json

"generate:dev": "graphql-codegen -r dotenv/config --config ./codegen.yaml",

"generate:prod": "graphql-codegen -r dotenv/config --config ./codegenProd.yaml",

```

## Eslint & Prettier

Having structured and organized code isn't a nice have, but it's a must. With the help of Eslint, a javascript linter and Prettier, a file formater, it is possible to achieve structured code organization, from solo developer to large teams.


=== "Install development dependencies"
```bash
yarn add -D eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-node eslint-config-node
```


=== "Install Airbnb Style Guide"
```bash
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
```
The Airbnb style guide is a popular set of rules defined by Airbnb for Javascript

=== "Create Eslint Configuration Fike"
```bash
eslint --init
```


=== "Eslint Configuration"
```yaml
env:
  browser: true
  es2021: true
extends:
  - 'eslint:recommended'
  - 'plugin:react/recommended'
  - 'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'
  - 'airbnb'
parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser'
parserOptions:
  ecmaFeatures:
    jsx: true
  ecmaVersion: 12
  sourceType: module
plugins:
  - react
  - '@typescript-eslint'
  - "prettier"
rules: {
  "quotes": ["error", "double"],
  "no-unused-vars":"warn",
  "no-console":"off"
}
```
