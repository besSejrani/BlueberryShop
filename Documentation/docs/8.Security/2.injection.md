# Injections

### Express-mongo-sanitize

Like SQL databases, injections can be performed by malicious users against a NoSQL database.

Express-mongo-sanitize is a middleware, it will sanitize the incoming requests and replace the injections with ASCII characters.

=== "Typescript"

```typescript
import mongoSanitize from "express-mongo-sanitize";

app.use(mongoSanitize());
```
