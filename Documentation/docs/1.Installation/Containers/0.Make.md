# Make

<hr />

## Use Case

Make allows to automate a program's build process. By installing the project via containers, make is mostly used to inject a environement variable to Docker-Compose which will then be injected in the application.

=== "Makefile"

    ```make
    # Production
    run-prod:
            ENVIRONMENT=production docker-compose up --build

    # Development
    run-dev:
            ENVIRONMENT=development docker-compose up --build

    # Test
    run-test:
            ENVIRONMENT=test docker-compose up --build

    ```

## Installation

=== "Windows"

    Make for Windows can be installed via the following [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/make-3.81.exe/download?use_mirror=jztkft&download=).

    Don't forget to add Make's path to your environement variables if the installer doesn't do it automatically.

=== "Brew"

    ```sh
    brew install make
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ```sh
    # Update & upgrade packages
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

    # Install Make
    sudo apt install make
    ```

## Containers

=== "List Containers"

    ```yaml
    docker-compose ps
    ```

=== "Stop Containers"

    ```yaml
    docker-compose down
    ```

=== "Delete All Docker Containers & Volumes"

    ```
