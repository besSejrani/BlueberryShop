# GraphQL

## Specification

GraphQL is only an API specification, it's server side implementation depends on the GraphQL [Specs](https://spec.graphql.org/). Since it is a specification, it can also work well, along REST APIs.

<hr/>

## No Under & Over Data Fetching

In modern web applications, it isn't common to perform multiple requests to a REST API and just use a fraction of the data to display it on the screen. If the data is quiet large and nested, then the longer a user will wait for a response.

One of the biggest problems that GraphQL resolves is that it doesn't peform under or over fetching data. It gives you only the data that you asked for.

=== "GraphQL Query"

```graphql
query {
  getProducts {
    products {
      _id
      name
      price
      description
      stock
      promotion
      status
      productImages
    }
    count
  }
}
```

<hr/>

## Autonomous Frontend

One other benefit of GraphQL is that it allows the frontend to work autonomously from the backend, since there is just one API endpoint, the backend can freely add resources without impacting the frontend.

## Documentation

Documentation should be treated as code, but often, it is considered as an afterthought.

In GraphQL, it is possible to add the documentation directly to the schema and add resource deprecation warnings. Doing so, the documentation can always be up to date and can change easily.

Writing a side documentation with the help of Swagger isn't bad, but we, as humans, have a tendency to forget to modify and push the documentation on version control when being on a hurry.

Like mentioned, documentation must always be treated as code.

<hr/>

## Caching

A GraphQL request is performed under a HTTP POST request, meaning that a request can't be natively cached without loaders.

Facebook, the creator of GraphQL, has also created [Dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader), a generic utility which allows to cache GraphQL requests and send the response in batches.

By implementing Dataloader, the GraphQL N+1 query problem can be solved.
