## Jest Configuration

=== "Configuration file"

```typescript
// TS Paths
const getJestMappersFromTSConfig = require("tsconfig-paths-jest-mapper");
const moduleNameMapper = getJestMappersFromTSConfig();
// ========================================================================

module.exports = {
  preset: "ts-jest",
  testEnvironment: "node",
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/src/utils/test/setup.ts"],
  moduleNameMapper,
};
```

## Two ways of testing

Testing a project can be done in two different ways, it depends on the perspective.

Doing a lot of unit tests in the application is easy to implement and gives the confidence that each tested function / method applies the separation of concern rule.

The downside is that it doesn't give much information about how the system, as a all, behaves. Further integration tests and end-to-end tests are required.

In reverse, a lot of end-to-end tests can be implemented in contrast to unit tests, they help to immediately show some results.

The downside is that the lack of unit testing can be the source of issues.

| Jest    |          [Link](https://jestjs.io/)           | Jest is a testing library built by Facebook. It is a test runner providing data mocking, code coverage and snapshots. Jest is great for testing units tests and integration tests. |
| Ts-Jest | [Link](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/) | Ts-Jest is a Jest trasnformer which allows to test Typescript projects                                                                                                             |
