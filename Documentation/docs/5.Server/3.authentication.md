# Authentication

Authentication is a broad topic, it can be achived in many ways, like session and cookies, session and in-memory database like Redis, and so on.

At the end of the day, authentication is all about tradeofs, control or scalability.

### Session Authentication

Using sessions for authentication gives great control over the service that the application provides to the end user.

For obvious reasons, an administrator can create, ban, block or delete a user.

### JWT Authentication

Json Web Tokens are great for scalability, when using tokens, an extra round trip to the database is saved, improving performance and user experience.

The down side of JWT tokens is that when the server emits a token, it has no more control over it. So, if a user violates a rule of conduct, the administrator can't block that user immediatly.

A way to resolve this, is to add a Time To Live value to the token.
