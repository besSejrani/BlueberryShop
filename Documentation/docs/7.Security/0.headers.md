# Security Headers

## Helmet

Helmet is a Node.js middleware which allows to set security headers. By default, it adds a Powered-By header, adds a XSS header and much more. Like mentionned on their website, it's not a silver bullet, but it can help.

For the moment, the content security policy is set to false, since it blocks the GraphQL Playground, it is temporary.

=== "Typescript"

```typescript
import helmet from "helmet";

app.use(helmet({ contentSecurityPolicy: false }));
```
