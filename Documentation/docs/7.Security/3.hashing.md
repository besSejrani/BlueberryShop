# Hashing

Hashing is a unique process of transforming data of variable length into fixed length. This process can also be composed of a secret and a salt in order to limit mass dictionary attacks.

| Algorithm | Length                                                                                          |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MD5       | 128 bits, not recommended                                                                       |
| SHA-1     | 160 bits                                                                                        |
| SHA-256   | 256 bits                                                                                        |
| SHA-512   | 512 bits                                                                                        |
| Bcrypt    | This hash function is very slow in order to dissuade malicious people from making mass attacks. |
| Scrypt    | This hash function is very expensive in RAM, making the bulk attack very expensive.             |

### Bcryptjs

Bcryptjs is a NPM package which allows to implement the Bcrypt algorithm, it's simple API is easy to use.

=== "Hash Data"

    ```Typescript

    import bcrypt from "bcryptjs"

    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(12);
    const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);

    ```

=== "Compare Hash"

    ```typescript
    import bcrypt from "bcryptjs";

    const valid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
    ```
