<hr/>
!!! information

    When using docker-compose, Nginx is available as reverse proxy on https://localhost:8443, it uses a self signed certificate. Keep in mind that self signed certificates should only be used in development environment, they must not be used in production !

##  Let's Encrypt & Certbot


> A nonprofit Certificate Authority providing TLS certificates to 260 million websites.

With the help of Let's Encrypt, there is no excuse for sending plain data over HTTP when HTTPS can easily be implemented in production.

Certbot, another great tool, helps to implement Let's Encrypt Certificate on Nginx, Apache, Envoy, ...

Although the TLS certificates of Let's Encrypt are easy to implement with the help of Certbot, they last only for 90 days. Use cron jobs to automate scheduling tasks.
