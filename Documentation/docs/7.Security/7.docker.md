## Image Limitation

Docker highly recommands to only use trusted images. As for their best practices, it is also recommanded to scan docker images in development environment and in production environment.

## Privileged containers and capabilities

By default, docker container does not have many capabilities assigned to them and they are not allowed to access any devices.

However, there are several types of capabilities that Linux provides, which gives granular access to containers.

If those capabilities are not used, disable them in your Dockerfile or in your orchestration yaml file, just use what you need.

## Resource Limitation

By default, a container can user as much resource as the the host’s kernel scheduler allows. When only using docker by itself, without any orchestration engine like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, it is recommended to specify resource constraints.

|CPU Option|Description|
|:------|:----|
|--cpus|Specify how much of the available CPU resources a container can use|
|--cpu-period|Specify the CPU CFS scheduler period, which is used alongside --cpu-quota.|
|--cpu-quota|Impose a CPU CFS quota on the container. The number of microseconds per --cpu-period that the container is limited to before throttled|
|--cpuset-cpus| Limit the specific CPUs or cores a container can use.|
|--cpu-shares| Set this flag to a value greater or less than the default of 1024 to increase or reduce the container’s weight, and give it access to a greater or lesser proportion of the host machine’s CPU cycles|


|Memory Option|Description|
|:------|:----|
|-m or --memory|The maximum amount of memory the container can use.|
|--memory-swap*|The amount of memory this container is allowed to swap to disk|
|--memory-swappiness|By default, the host kernel can swap out a percentage of anonymous pages used by a container.|
|--memory-reservation|Allows you to specify a soft limit smaller than --memory which is activated when Docker detects contention or low memory on the host machine|
|--kernel-memory|The maximum amount of kernel memory the container can use.|
|--oom-kill-disable|By default, if an out-of-memory (OOM) error occurs, the kernel kills processes in a container. To change this behavior, use the --oom-kill-disable option.|
