## Time To Live MongoDB

The forgot password functionnality relies on a specific TTL value to be executed. In MongoDB it is possible to specify a an expiration time, but it deletes the entier document not just a individual field.

To resolve this issue, Redis will be used instead. Redis feels just to be the right tool for the right job. Heroku offers a free tier, it's plenty enough.

```javascript

@Property({ expires: "30s", default: Date.now() })
changePassword: Date;
```
