Hi guys, does one of you know how to send a cookie via cross-origin ? 
I'm stuck, i have a nextjs frontend and an express backend, coupled with GraphQL.

this is the cookie that i try to send, i even tried to add a self signed certificate,
just in case to confirm if the secure option was wrong, it didnt work. I also tried SameSite: none, same result

# Backend
context.res.cookie("refresh-token", token, {
      maxAge: (60 * 60 * 1000 * 24 * 10) as number,
      httpOnly: true,
      domain: "localhost",
      secure: true,
      path: "/",
      sameSite: "lax",
    });

# Cors options
const corsOptions = {
  origin: "https://localhost:8443",
  credentials: true,
};

# Apollo client
export const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  link: authMiddleware.concat(link),
  cache,
  credentials: "include",
  ssrMode: true,
});
