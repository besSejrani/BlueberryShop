# Node.js

<hr />

## Javascript Runtime

<br />

Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment and not a programming language. It'uses Chrome's open source Javascript engine, V8. By incorporating V8, it has access to the OS APIs. Since Javascript is single threated, is uses an Event Loop, an Event Queue and a thread Pool for executing asychronous tasks.

Node.js is highly performant for I/O tasks, but struggles with CPU instensive tasks, like file uploads.

## Express Middlewares

<br />

Express is a light server built on top of Node.js, it comes with a lot of functionnalities and can be set really quickly.One important feature of Express, is that it is middleware based.

Think of a middleware like a function that executes before a controller in a MVC architecture. Doing so, it is possible for example, to authenticate and authorize users and add business Logic in middlewares.

In Express, any function which accepts requests and send a next() function back, is considered as a valid middleware.

## Other Solutions

### Deno

<br />

The server could also have been build on Deno, with the Oak framework, but as for the 24 March 2021, Deno is still in version 1.8, for production use, it is recommended to wait a bit more.

Deno was created by the same author as Node.js, Ryan Dahl.Concerning Node.js, he had some regrets that he wanted to correct with Deno, like promises, the package manager, security, ...

For this project, Deno wasn't choosed because of the learning curve due to the short deadline and the project's maturity.

### Golang

<br />

An other solution would have been to use Golang. Golang, also called Go, is a programming language designed in Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.

Go was created at a time, in 2006-2007, when multi-core processors first came out. The authors wanted to move away from single threated architectures and implement concurrency.

Concurrency is the process of managing a lot of things at the same time, compared to parallelism, which is the process of doing a lot of things at the same time.

Go is almost has fast as C++, it uses channels instead of threads, it implements concurrency, there is no need to worry about memory since it comes with a garbage collector and it's easy to learn.

For this project, Golang wasn't choosed because of the learning curve due to the short deadline.
